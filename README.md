# Zi Yen's App
This project includes all application files and its unit tests file. The app related file are in the folder "firebaseTest", and the unit tests related files are in the projectUnitTests file. The project is named as firebaseTest because when the project was started, the naming of the project has not been decided yet.

# How to run
As I am using XCode IDE to develop the project, I uses all features provided by XCode to run the project. This requires a Mac/macOS device to run the application (applies to all swift projects).

Open the **firebaseTest.xcodeproj** file using XCode, then run the application by cliking the run button on at the top left section of the navigator on XCode interface. The simulator will then launch once the application is successfully run and built. A clear instruction with images can be found on https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device

To run all test, in XCode, go to the Test Navigator. Then, hold the pointer over the test bundle name, "projectUnitTests", and click the Run button that appears on the right.
