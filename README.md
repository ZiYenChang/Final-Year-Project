# Zi Yen's App
A task management

# How to run
As I am using XCode IDE to develop the project, I uses all features provided by XCode to run the project. Open the firebaseTest.xcodeproj file using XCode, then build run the application by cliking the run button on at the top left section of the navigator on XCode interface. The simulator will then launch once the application is successfully run and built.
